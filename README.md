## Cloning the repo

If you would like to get in sync with repo, get the updates or contribute, you need the clone the repo.

 1. Download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
 2. Open Git Bash, navigate to target folder (wherever you like) with `cd FOLDERNAME` for going in, `cd ..` for going out
 3. Clone the repo by `git clone https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject.git`
 4. Get updates every day by `git pull`

  It is recommended that you clone the repository in your `xampp/htdocs` folder, so you can easily run all the applications in your `localhost`.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Contact me on Slack or at `gaboratorium@gmail.com` to ask for contributor access (to be able to push to `master`).
In case of collaboration please:

- **Create a folder with your name**, work in your own folder
- **In your folder, structure your content day-by-day** with the following date format: `yy-mm-dd` e.g.: `16-08-23`
- **Use understandable commit messages** referring to the content inside e.g.: `Arrays and for loops`.
- **Use comments in your code.** This is crucial. As the purpose of this repo is to share knowledge and work with others, please make it as easy-to-read as possible (and actually it is a good practice in general).
